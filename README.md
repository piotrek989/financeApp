# 💼 Internship Project – Personal Finance Manager

This project is a desktop application created as part of my internship, designed to help users manage their **personal finances**. It allows users to **register, log in, track incomes and expenses**, and **visualize data** through various charts. The backend uses **PostgreSQL** via **pgAdmin**, and the frontend was built with **JavaFX**.
